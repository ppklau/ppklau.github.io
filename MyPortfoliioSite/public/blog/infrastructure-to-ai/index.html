    <div class="post-content">
        <div class="container-narrow">
            <p>Twenty years ago, I started my career as a network engineer, configuring routers and troubleshooting protocols. Today, I&rsquo;m leading firmwide AI strategy at a global financial institution. The journey from infrastructure to artificial intelligence might seem discontinuous, but the thread connecting them is stronger than it appears.</p>
<h2 id="the-foundation-building-reliable-systems">The Foundation: Building Reliable Systems</h2>
<p>My early years were spent in the trenches—literally underground data centers at times—ensuring that critical systems stayed operational. At companies like JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, I learned that in financial services, downtime isn&rsquo;t just inconvenient: it&rsquo;s measured in millions of dollars per minute and regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<p>This environment taught me fundamental lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reliability is non-negotiable.</strong> Systems must work, period. There&rsquo;s no &ldquo;move fast and break things&rdquo; when you&rsquo;re processing billions in transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity requires discipline.</strong> As infrastructure grew more complex, only rigorous processes, documentation, and change management kept chaos at bay.</li>
<li><strong>Security is foundational, not an afterthought.</strong> In regulated environments, every system decision has security implications.</li>
</ul>
<p>These weren&rsquo;t abstract principles—they were daily realities enforced by incidents, audits, and regulatory reviews.</p>
<h2 id="the-evolution-security-and-automation">The Evolution: Security and Automation</h2>
<p>As I moved into cybersecurity and security platforms, the problems became more nuanced. It wasn&rsquo;t just about keeping systems running; it was about protecting them against sophisticated threats while enabling business velocity.</p>
<p>This is where automation became critical. I wrote Python scripts to orchestrate security controls, built monitoring platforms that could process millions of events, and developed DevOps pipelines that brought security into the development lifecycle.</p>
<p>The patterns were familiar:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define what &ldquo;good&rdquo; looks like (SLOs for reliability, security policies for protection)</li>
<li>Instrument systems to measure reality against expectations</li>
<li>Automate responses where possible, escalate intelligently when not</li>
<li>Continuously improve through retrospectives and data-driven insights</li>
</ul>
<p>I was essentially applying SRE principles to cybersecurity before I knew that&rsquo;s what I was doing.</p>
<h2 id="the-transition-ai-as-infrastructure">The Transition: AI as Infrastructure</h2>
<p>When I transitioned to leading AI and GenAI strategy, colleagues asked if I was making a radical career pivot. I didn&rsquo;t see it that way.</p>
<p><strong>AI platforms are infrastructure.</strong> They require the same reliability, security, and governance discipline as any mission-critical system. The stakes might be higher—AI can make consequential decisions affecting customers, employees, and regulatory compliance—but the fundamental engineering principles remain constant.</p>
<p>What I brought from two decades in infrastructure:</p>
<h3 id="risk-first-thinking"><strong>Risk-First Thinking</strong></h3>
<p>Before deploying any AI system, we assess: What could go wrong? What are the failure modes? How do we detect and respond to them? This is exactly how I approached network and security infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="governance-as-code"><strong>Governance as Code</strong></h3>
<p>Just as we codified security policies and infrastructure as code, we now codify AI governance: model evaluation criteria, deployment gates, monitoring thresholds, incident response procedures. If it&rsquo;s not automated and measurable, it won&rsquo;t scale.</p>
<h3 id="obsession-with-observability"><strong>Obsession with Observability</strong></h3>
<p>You can&rsquo;t manage what you can&rsquo;t measure. AI systems need comprehensive instrumentation: model performance metrics, data quality checks, drift detection, fairness evaluations, usage patterns. I build AI monitoring the same way I built security monitoring—with the assumption that we&rsquo;ll need to explain every decision to an auditor.</p>
<h3 id="operationalization-mindset"><strong>Operationalization Mindset</strong></h3>
<p>The difference between a proof-of-concept and a production system is immense. I&rsquo;ve seen too many brilliant demos fail in production because they lacked operational rigor. When evaluating AI use cases, I immediately think about: deployment architecture, scaling constraints, monitoring requirements, incident response, regulatory compliance.</p>
<h2 id="the-constant-solving-hard-problems-at-scale">The Constant: Solving Hard Problems at Scale</h2>
<p>Across network engineering, security, and now AI, the underlying challenge is the same: <strong>building systems that are reliable, secure, and compliant at global scale in highly regulated environments.</strong></p>
<p>The technologies change. The protocols evolve. But the discipline required to operate critical infrastructure successfully remains constant.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-wish-id-known-earlier">What I Wish I&rsquo;d Known Earlier</h2>
<p>If I could advise my younger self:</p>
<p><strong>Deep technical skills compound.</strong> Every layer of the stack I learned—from TCP/IP to Kubernetes to LLMs—builds on the previous. There are no wasted experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Soft skills matter more than you think.</strong> The hardest problems aren&rsquo;t technical; they&rsquo;re organizational. Getting legal, risk, compliance, and engineering aligned requires communication, empathy, and patience.</p>
<p><strong>Embrace the discomfort of change.</strong> I&rsquo;ve reinvented my role every few years, learning new domains and technologies. Each transition felt risky at the time but proved invaluable in retrospect.</p>
<p><strong>The fundamentals transcend specific technologies.</strong> Systems thinking, risk management, operational discipline—these skills transfer across any domain.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the early days of enterprise AI adoption. The field will evolve rapidly, and today&rsquo;s cutting-edge techniques will become tomorrow&rsquo;s infrastructure.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m confident that the principles I&rsquo;ve honed over 20 years—building reliable, secure, well-governed systems—will remain essential. The best AI systems won&rsquo;t just be the most capable; they&rsquo;ll be the most trustworthy, observable, and operationally excellent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where infrastructure expertise meets AI innovation. And that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m betting my next 20 years.</p>
