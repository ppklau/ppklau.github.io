summary: "Why network automation is the foundation for effective and safe use of AI in financial-services networks."

I was recently asked a deceptively simple question:

*“What can you use AI for when maintaining a network in the finance industry?”*

It’s tempting to answer with a list of impressive AI capabilities—predictive analytics, self-healing networks, autonomous operations. But for financial services, that kind of answer is not just unhelpful, it’s risky. The real answer depends far less on what AI *can* do and far more on **where your organization is today**.

In heavily regulated, risk‑sensitive environments, AI should never be the starting point. Automation, process maturity and team structure must come first.

## “If it Ain’t Broke” — A Misunderstood Principle

In my years in the industry, I’ve often carried the mantra:

*“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”*

This isn’t an argument for clinging to legacy technology. In finance, stability *is* a feature. The phrase is really a prompt to ask a more important question: **what problem are we actually trying to solve?**

Upgrades, new platforms and AI initiatives should be driven by clearly identified issues—risk exposure, operational inefficiency, scalability constraints—not by vendor pressure or fear of falling behind.

The pace of technological change is relentless. If your teams are not actively leading the conversation, you will inevitably become reactive—adopting solutions on someone else’s timeline, aligned to someone else’s incentives.

## The A‑Team: The Foundation of Any Automation or AI Strategy

Successful network automation—and by extension, safe AI adoption—starts with people. Tools amplify capability; they do not replace judgment.

### Senior Leadership

The most effective senior leaders set clear direction and trust their teams to execute. In financial services, leadership must articulate *why* change is necessary: whether it’s faster product delivery, improved resilience, regulatory compliance, or cost control.

Leadership’s role is not to dictate implementation details, but to remove obstacles, challenge assumptions and reinforce accountability—while ensuring risk is understood and managed.

### Product Management

Not every engineer is equipped to translate technical decisions into business outcomes. Strong Product Managers bridge that gap.

They balance competing priorities: time‑to‑market versus stability, innovation versus regulatory scrutiny, cost versus resilience. In mature organizations, Product Managers are essential in aligning network capabilities with business strategy and influencing vendor roadmaps to meet financial‑industry requirements.

### Network Architecture

Network Architects carry institutional memory. They understand *why* design decisions were made and ensure that new technologies integrate safely with existing environments.

In finance, architecture is inseparable from risk management. Architects must design for resilience, security, auditability and failure containment—while avoiding blind adoption of vendor‑driven architectures that don’t align with regulatory or operational realities.

### Network Engineering

Network Engineers turn strategy into production reality. This includes design, deployment, operations and increasingly, automation.

In infrastructure, engineering is never “done.” The differentiator is continuous improvement—not just of the network, but of how work is performed. The right engineers are curious, disciplined and comfortable working with code, testing and version control. These traits matter far more than any single tool or platform.

Trust binds this team together. Without it, automation initiatives stall and AI adoption becomes superficial at best.

## What Is Actually Broken?

With the right team in place, identifying problems becomes far easier. In financial‑services networks, recurring themes often include:

- Change‑related outages and rollback failures
- Inconsistent or prolonged MTTR
- Slow implementation of business requests
- Growing operational backlogs
- Long onboarding times for new engineers
- Rising run‑the‑bank costs

When issues are primarily people‑ or process‑driven, organizations are usually early in their automation journey. This is why **network automation—not AI—is almost always the correct first focus**.

NetDevOps, much like DevOps, requires a cultural shift: standardization, repeatability, testing and shared ownership. Done well, it unlocks both operational stability and staff potential.

Whatever problem you tackle first, metrics matter. Define your baseline and your target:

- How many incidents occurred in the last 60 days?
- What is your current MTTR?
- How long does it take to implement a standard change?

Clear metrics align teams and turn improvement into a collective effort rather than an abstract goal.

## Can AI Help Maintain a Financial‑Services Network?

Yes—but only when applied deliberately and at the right stage of maturity.

### Early Automation: AI as a Knowledge Amplifier

For organizations early in their automation journey, AI is most valuable as a knowledge amplifier for people. Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can act as controlled, auditable knowledge bases—supporting troubleshooting, onboarding and operational consistency.

Used correctly, these systems reduce dependency on tribal knowledge while remaining compatible with regulatory and security requirements.

### Mature Automation: AI as a Force Multiplier

Teams with established automation practices should already be solving problems with code and avoiding one‑off fixes. Here, AI becomes a powerful partner.

AI‑assisted development can dramatically reduce lead time for automation tasks, allowing engineers to focus on intent, validation and risk controls rather than boilerplate implementation. The key is discipline: version control, testing and review processes remain non‑negotiable.

### Advanced Operations: AI for Insight and Prediction

In well‑run environments, AI and ML can be applied to telemetry, capacity data and fault patterns. Anomaly detection and trend analysis enable earlier intervention and better planning—critical in environments where outages carry outsized financial and reputational impact.

This is not about autonomous networks. It is about **better decision support** for human operators.

## Final Thoughts

AI is evolving at an extraordinary pace, but financial‑services networks cannot afford experimentation without foundations. Automation, process maturity and strong teams are prerequisites—not optional steps.

Organizations that invest in these fundamentals will be well positioned to use AI safely and effectively. Those that skip them may adopt impressive tools—but will struggle to realize lasting value.
