summary: "How two decades of building critical infrastructure prepared me for leading AI strategy in regulated environments."

Twenty years ago, I started my career as a network engineer, configuring routers and troubleshooting protocols. Today, I'm leading firmwide AI strategy at a global financial institution. The journey from infrastructure to artificial intelligence might seem discontinuous, but the thread connecting them is stronger than it appears.

## The Foundation: Building Reliable Systems

My early years were spent in the trenches—literally underground data centers at times—ensuring that critical systems stayed operational. At companies like JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, I learned that in financial services, downtime isn't just inconvenient: it's measured in millions of dollars per minute and regulatory scrutiny.

This environment taught me fundamental lessons:

- **Reliability is non-negotiable.** Systems must work, period. There's no "move fast and break things" when you're processing billions in transactions.
- **Complexity requires discipline.** As infrastructure grew more complex, only rigorous processes, documentation, and change management kept chaos at bay.
- **Security is foundational, not an afterthought.** In regulated environments, every system decision has security implications.

These weren't abstract principles—they were daily realities enforced by incidents, audits, and regulatory reviews.

## The Evolution: Security and Automation

As I moved into cybersecurity and security platforms, the problems became more nuanced. It wasn't just about keeping systems running; it was about protecting them against sophisticated threats while enabling business velocity.

This is where automation became critical. I wrote Python scripts to orchestrate security controls, built monitoring platforms that could process millions of events, and developed DevOps pipelines that brought security into the development lifecycle.

The patterns were familiar:
- Define what "good" looks like (SLOs for reliability, security policies for protection)
- Instrument systems to measure reality against expectations
- Automate responses where possible, escalate intelligently when not
- Continuously improve through retrospectives and data-driven insights

I was essentially applying SRE principles to cybersecurity before I knew that's what I was doing.

## The Transition: AI as Infrastructure

When I transitioned to leading AI and GenAI strategy, colleagues asked if I was making a radical career pivot. I didn't see it that way.

**AI platforms are infrastructure.** They require the same reliability, security, and governance discipline as any mission-critical system. The stakes might be higher—AI can make consequential decisions affecting customers, employees, and regulatory compliance—but the fundamental engineering principles remain constant.

What I brought from two decades in infrastructure:

### **Risk-First Thinking**
Before deploying any AI system, we assess: What could go wrong? What are the failure modes? How do we detect and respond to them? This is exactly how I approached network and security infrastructure.

### **Governance as Code**
Just as we codified security policies and infrastructure as code, we now codify AI governance: model evaluation criteria, deployment gates, monitoring thresholds, incident response procedures. If it's not automated and measurable, it won't scale.

### **Obsession with Observability**
You can't manage what you can't measure. AI systems need comprehensive instrumentation: model performance metrics, data quality checks, drift detection, fairness evaluations, usage patterns. I build AI monitoring the same way I built security monitoring—with the assumption that we'll need to explain every decision to an auditor.

### **Operationalization Mindset**
The difference between a proof-of-concept and a production system is immense. I've seen too many brilliant demos fail in production because they lacked operational rigor. When evaluating AI use cases, I immediately think about: deployment architecture, scaling constraints, monitoring requirements, incident response, regulatory compliance.

## The Constant: Solving Hard Problems at Scale

Across network engineering, security, and now AI, the underlying challenge is the same: **building systems that are reliable, secure, and compliant at global scale in highly regulated environments.**

The technologies change. The protocols evolve. But the discipline required to operate critical infrastructure successfully remains constant.

## What I Wish I'd Known Earlier

If I could advise my younger self:

**Deep technical skills compound.** Every layer of the stack I learned—from TCP/IP to Kubernetes to LLMs—builds on the previous. There are no wasted experiences.

**Soft skills matter more than you think.** The hardest problems aren't technical; they're organizational. Getting legal, risk, compliance, and engineering aligned requires communication, empathy, and patience.

**Embrace the discomfort of change.** I've reinvented my role every few years, learning new domains and technologies. Each transition felt risky at the time but proved invaluable in retrospect.

**The fundamentals transcend specific technologies.** Systems thinking, risk management, operational discipline—these skills transfer across any domain.

## Looking Forward

We're in the early days of enterprise AI adoption. The field will evolve rapidly, and today's cutting-edge techniques will become tomorrow's infrastructure.

But I'm confident that the principles I've honed over 20 years—building reliable, secure, well-governed systems—will remain essential. The best AI systems won't just be the most capable; they'll be the most trustworthy, observable, and operationally excellent.

That's where infrastructure expertise meets AI innovation. And that's where I'm betting my next 20 years.
